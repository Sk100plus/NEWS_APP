Methods in REACT component LIFECYCLE
. The render( ) method is used to render HTML of the component
in react.This method is required for a class based component to render
DOM. It runs during the mounting and updating of your component.
render() method should be pure i.e you can not modify state inside it.

//After render run hen it will runs.
.The componentDidUpdate() method runs after the component output has
been rendered to the DOM.

.The componentDidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating
happens. The most common use case for the componentDidUpdate()
method is updating DOM in response to prop or state changes.

.The componentWillUnmount() lifecyclee method is called just before the 
component is unmounted and destroyed . Usually used o perform cleanups.


Updating will be done in three ways:
1. New props.
2. setState().
3. forceUpdate().
Mounting --->> constructor-->> componentDidMount.
Updating -->> componentDidUpdate.
Unmounting -->> componentWillUnmount.
